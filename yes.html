    <h1>Yayyy! I know we have known each other for just a few days, but I have been so happy these days just because of you. I want to come to college just so that I can spend some time with you. I wish you were by my side all day long. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, there’s one thing constantly on my mind, and that’s you.

I consider myself lucky because you came into my life and made it so much better, so much more meaningful. I love everything about you,from your beautiful smile to your mesmerizing eyes, from your sweet voice to your “I’m the boss” mood. I want to be that person in your life with whom you can be YOU, the person with whom you feel most comfortable, the person you trust your secrets with, the person you go to in tough times, and the person you can truly be happy with.💗🥰</h1>
